    abstract={EinsteinPy performs General Relativity and gravitational physics
    tasks, including geodesics plotting for Schwarzschild, Kerr and Kerr Newman
    space-time models, calculation of Schwarzschild radius, and calculation of
    event horizon and ergosphere for Kerr space-time. It can perform symbolic
    manipulations of various tensors such as Metric, Riemann, Ricci and
    Christoffel symbols. EinsteinPy also features hypersurface embedding of
    Schwarzschild space-time, and includes other utilities and functions. It is
    a community-developed package and is written in Python.},

    eprint={2008.13611},
    archivePrefix={arXiv},
    abstract={We study the usage of EfficientNets and their applications to
    Galaxy Morphology Classification. We explore the usage of EfficientNets into
    predicting the vote fractions of the 79,975 testing images from the Galaxy
    Zoo 2 challenge on Kaggle. We evaluate this model using the standard
    competition metric i.e. rmse score and rank among the top 3 on the public
    leaderboard with a public score of 0.07765. We propose a fine-tuned
    architecture using EfficientNetB5 to classify galaxies into seven classes -
    completely round smooth, in-between smooth, cigarshaped smooth, lenticular,
    barred spiral, unbarred spiral and irregular. The network along with other
    popular convolutional networks are used to classify 29,941 galaxy images.
    Different metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score are used to
    evaluate the performance of the model along with a comparative study of
    other state of the art convolutional models to determine which one performs
    the best. We obtain an accuracy of 93.7% on our classification model with an
    F1 score of 0.8857. EfficientNets can be applied to large scale galaxy
    classification in future optical space surveys which will provide a large
    amount of data such as the Large Synoptic Space Telescope.},

  title={Astronomical Image Colorization and Up-scaling with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks},
  author={Kalvankar, Shreyas and Pandit, Hrushikesh and Parwate, Pranav and Patil, Atharva and Kamalapur, Snehal},
  year={2022},
  publisher={Gesellschaft f{\"u}r Informatik, Bonn},
  abstract={This research aims to provide an automated approach for the problem
  of Image colorization and Single Image Super Resolution by focusing on a very
  specific domain: astronomical images, using Generative Adversarial Networks.
  We explore the usage of various models in RBG and L*a*b color spaces. We use
  transfer learning owing to a small data set, using pre-trained ResNet-18 as a
  backbone encoder and fine-tune it further. The model produces visually
  appealing images that are high resolution and colorized. We present our
  results by evaluating the GANs quantitatively using distance metrics such as
  L1 distance and L2 distance in each of the color spaces across all channels to
  provide a comparative analysis. We use Fréchet inception distance (FID) to
  compare the distribution of the generated images and real image to assess the
  model's performance.},
