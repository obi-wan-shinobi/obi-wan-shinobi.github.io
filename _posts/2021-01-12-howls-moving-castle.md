Ghibli brings us another masterpiece in the form of Howl’s Moving
Castle which, in my opinion, is widely underrated and misunderstood. Its
important to observe how Studio Ghibli gets more and more intricate with
all the films that it produces and it clearly shows how Miyazaki matures as
a director as he makes Howl’s Moving Castle and how that is reflected in
him making a film about adulthood.

Howl’s Moving Castle, at first watch, seems like a fairy tale, which is what
most people focus on albeit failing to notice the complexity and intertwining
of different layers of the movie. As with all other Miyazaki films, there are a
lot of layers to Howl’s moving castle. The fairy tale layer, mythology layer,
environmental layer and more. The most important being that over time as
Miyazaki matures as a director, his films that were already complex, become
even more complex and granular. There are entire story arcs that happen
within a moment that contribute to the character development. And with
every re-watch, we can spot newer and newer things owing to the scenes that
are so tightly packed that Miyazaki probably just wanted people watching
it again and again. For instance you can see that Sophie appears different
in every scene throughout the film depending on the context or the war that
is developing in the background that suddenly pounces off in the latter half
of the film. One can observe how Miyazaki is reusing his own symbols from
his previous films in forms of metaphors that he has already introduced
in a different context. Like the umbrella from Totoro. That is how the
Miyazaki theory takes root in the modern standing where symbolism is
at utmost importance that Miyazaki uses to convey a message. When we
watch animation, we expect to see things that are out of the ordinary and
Miyazaki’s unique gift is to infuse the ordinary with magical qualities.

Even the most boring of the daily chores, cleaning, is given these treat-
ments. There is an awe inspiring attention to details and a sense of wonder
in those details is what makes those scenes that much more transporting. Of
course, the great thing about this film is that if you don’t want, you don’t
have to pay attention to any of these details and go with the story because
it’s based so well on the characters that you can go through the story as one
of them and get your own emotional breakthroughs.

In a press conference, Miyazaki said, _”While always saying that I have to or want to make films for children, in reality I often forget about them. That’s how I end up creating films like Porco Rosso and Howl’s Moving Castle”_. And it is interesting in the sense that this film is about adulthood
more than other Miyazaki films which have some sort of coming-of-age story
going on whether its mythological or practical or growing up, trying to
find solutions to the problems that your parents’ generation has created or
growing up by finding a place in society and the modern world. And after all
these _coming-of-age_ stories, this is a film that stars people who are actively
trying to avoid adulthood.

Sohpie is shown to have a lovely outlook on life at the beginning of the
film. She doesn’t want to live her life making hats in the backroom, but her
experience of life is that it’s still better in there that out somewhere and
that’s a mutual sentiment which all introverts can empathize with. When
Sophie gets her ”curse”, it seems quite a relief for her which is not usually
how curses work. She is really quick to embrace what has happened and it
means that she can skip the adulting thing entirely.

Then we have Howl who is permanently stuck in adolescence. He loves
the power that comes with growing up but not the responsibilities. Through-
out the film he tries to be everything for everyone while being afraid of losing
control of his power and not being loved.

And his emotional breakdown reveals some of these things that his character is struggling with.

Then there’s Marco who we barely know but can deduce that he’s the
kind who has had to grow up too quickly for some reason. His actual job is
to pretend being an adult but in the later half of the film we learned that
what he needs is belonging and family.

Calcifer is the most ancient and mythological thing in the film who has
ties to the Hindu God Agni. Despite his roots, he’s actually dealing with
the same problems that the other characters are but in a more metaphorical
sense. His question is, _”What happens if I change? Can I change while remaining the same person that I am now? If I change, do I die?”_.

The short blink-and-you’ll-miss-it story line is of the dog that has exactly
one decision point in the entire film. It involves coming out of dependency
and stand for something which is why he joins the adventurers.

The final character is the house and people often overlook this but the
house itself is a character which changes throughout the film. The question
for the castle is the same as Calcifer, ”What happens if I keep changing?
Can I be put together again if I fall apart?”. And this latter question poses
an undertone in which the castle symbolizes Japan. And throughout the film, the castle grows and changes and it suffers but it survives all of the
changes, and these were the changes needed for it to grow and become more
of the house that we can all live in.

All the characters dealing with the difference in What I show to the
outside world vs How I am really feeling? is the Japanese separation of the
outward facing facade that people put on for society’s sake. Even the house
has its context dependent output faces.

The question is ”Why are these people trying to avoid being adults?”.
Well, its because of what adults are like. In the film, adults are greedy,
egoistic, manipulative, toxic. Looking at the adults that Sophie sees around
her, her colleagues who are super shallow and gossip about having a better
life but not doing anything about it. Her sister, whose life revolves around
looking pretty and pleasing men in return for attention. Her mother who
has a constant competition about being the best. And if that is what being
an adult is like for Sophie, its no wonder that you skip it.
Then there’s Howl’s adult, Soloman. A corrupt mother figure. A king
who’s an idiot father figure. The Witch of the waste is only interested in
magic because of the greed. And all the other wizards that did what they
were taught to do and ended up losing their humanity completely.
The point that the film makes is that even though all adults are horrible,
all these coping mechanisms that the characters use to avoid adulthood do
not work. Escapism is not the solution. Whatever magic the characters use,
the truth is under there. So they have to figure out how to become adults in
a way that they stay true to themselves. Miyazaki wants the characters to
live their true lives and find their true spirits. So the path that the characters
realize is of finding their true selves and story of the characters is to help
each other find their own true selves. The story fed is, How, who lives in
the delusion that he can solve everything with careful maneuvering. And of
other Miyazaki male heros, his learning curve is much steeper. Miyazaki’s
bottom line is that no war is worth going into. You cannot solve war by
winning it.

The ending is one of the weirder Miyazaki endings because by the end,
everything resolves suddenly. But if you watch the film close enough and
see the internal logic, the entire story was a set up to that ending. Miyazaki
achieves this with a combination of fairy tale rules and therapy rules. In
fairy tales, you find the point of the main plot and you solve it and the
kingdom gets magically restored. In therapy, you get down to the core of
your problem, crack it, get your breakthrough moment and the bigger the
change is, the bigger is the ripple effect on your life. And that is what
happens at the end of the film. People find their true hearts, literally. What is misplaced is replaced (the scarecrow), literally. And the violence stops
because the need for the thing that was substituted for violence was fulfilled
and there’s no more need for violence.

But the real statement is how the choice is not between becoming a
horrible adult or not growing up at all. The resolution comes from the
characters when they learn to define for themselves what adulthood is, what
family is, what is worth making a stand for and what is making effort for
and that’s the kind of adult that Miyazaki would like you to be.
