# About

The ABU Asia-Pacific Robot Contest (ABU Robocon) is an Asian-Oceanian college robot
competition, founded in 2002 by Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. In the competition robots
compete to complete a task within a set period of time.

In our robotics journey, we embarked on a two-fold project that allowed us to bring theoretical knowledge to life through practical application. The creation of a quadruped robot was a testament to our comprehensive understanding of kinematics, robotics, and motion planning. We meticulously programmed its gait using servo motors, ensuring it could move with both stability and agility.

Simultaneously, we tackled the development of a wheeled robot, focusing on optimizing its locomotive capabilities. Our programming efforts were geared toward efficiency, speed, and the ability to navigate complex terrains. These projects not only exemplified our dedication to the field of robotics but also showcased our ability to bridge the gap between theory and practice, resulting in the successful construction and programming of two distinct, autonomous robots.
