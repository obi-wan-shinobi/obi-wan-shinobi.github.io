The latest project by far which I haven't been able to work on after starting my job. It's still in it's early phases, and plans at providing an efficient
simulation of quantum systems

I delved into the intriguing world of quantum particle simulation, with a particular focus on single particle systems. My primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics by exploring and applying various numerical methods. The central problem I tackled was the solution of Schrödinger's Time Independent wave equation, a fundamental equation in quantum physics, which describes the behavior of quantum systems. In my case, I employed these methods to find stationary states of a particle confined within an Infinite Potential Well, a classic problem in quantum mechanics that serves as an important introductory example.

This research not only allowed me to grasp the essential principles of quantum mechanics but also provided valuable hands-on experience in solving complex problems using computational methods. The exploration of numerical techniques for solving Schrödinger's equation offered insights into the behavior of quantum particles and how they behave within different physical constraints, in this case, the Infinite Potential Well.

As a result of this research, I see significant prospects for contributing to the field of quantum physics. Specifically, I envision the development of an efficient and community-driven Python package designed for simulating quantum many-body systems using tensor networks. Such a package could facilitate the work of researchers and enthusiasts in the quantum field, providing them with a powerful tool for tackling complex quantum problems, simulations, and experiments. The integration of tensor networks into quantum simulations offers a promising avenue for tackling intricate many-body quantum systems, making this a noteworthy endeavor with the potential to benefit the broader scientific community.
