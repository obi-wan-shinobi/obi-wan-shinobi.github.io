My research interests lie in the theoretical foundations of machine learning,
with a focus on understanding neural networks and the mechanisms behind their
empirical success. I aim to use tools from functional analysis, operator
theory, and optimization dynamics to study gradient-based learning algorithms
and the structures they implicitly exploit. I am particularly interested in the
mathematical mechanisms underlying training dynamics, implicit bias,
generalization, and the transition between feature-learning and lazy regimes.

Broadly, I am motivated by questions at the intersection of machine learning
theory and mathematical analysis, aiming to develop a clearer understanding of
how modern learning algorithms behave and why they work.

I graduated with a _Bachelor's in Computer Engineering_ and briefly worked as an
ML researcher at [Relfor Labs](https://www.relfor.com/), where I specialized in developing deep neural networks for audio
data classification. I worked as a software developer at [Dalton
Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/) where I worked on genetic algorithms.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages, staying informed about
technological advancements in computer science, physics, and
mathematics, while also indulging in the study of history and linguistic
anthropology. I also enjoy typography and sketching. I play basketball:basketball:. Go Lakers!
