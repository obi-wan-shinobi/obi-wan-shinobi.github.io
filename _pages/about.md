My research interests are multifaceted, centering on machine learning and deep learning theory, with a strong inclination towards unraveling the underlying mathematics that power these cutting-edge technologies. I am particularly passionate about exploring the mathematical foundations of neural networks, optimization techniques, and the interplay between data and algorithms in these domains. Furthermore, I am deeply committed to applying modern deep learning algorithms to astrophysics, where they can enhance our understanding of celestial phenomena, numerical analysis, to improve computational simulations and accuracy, and to various mathematical challenges, where these techniques can be harnessed for innovative problem-solving. These pursuits drive my curiosity and ambition to push the boundaries of knowledge and discover novel intersections between the worlds of artificial intelligence and the sciences.
