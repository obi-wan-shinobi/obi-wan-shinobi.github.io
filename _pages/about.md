My research interests are rooted in the theoretical foundations of machine
learning and deep learning. I am particularly fascinated by the mathematical
underpinnings of these technologies. I'm dedicated to applying modern deep
learning algorithms to various fields, like astrophysics, where they can
facilitate the processing of data and enhance research efforts. Additionally, I
wish to explore their application in solving various mathematical challenges.
These interests drive my curiosity at the intersection of artificial
intelligence and scientific disciplines.

I am also interested in film analysis, literature analysis, and a
fascination for cultural linguistics. To that end, I am also interested in
unraveling the intricate connections between narratives, human expression, and
cultural dynamics using Natural Language Processing and and computer vision.

I have experience applying deep learning to astrophysics and am eager
to explore more efficient ways to harness these algorithms for scientific
advancement. I'm equally drawn to computational physics and simulations,
with a strong desire to construct systems and frameworks that enable efficient
and impactful simulations.

I graduated with a _Bachelor's in Computer Engineering_ and briefly worked as an
ML researcher at [Relfor Labs](https://www.relfor.com/), where I specialized in developing deep neural networks for audio
data classification. Presently, I work as a software developer at [Dalton
Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages, staying informed about
technological advancements in computer science, physics, and
mathematics, while also indulging in the study of history and linguistic
anthropology. I also enjoy typography and sketching. I play basketball:basketball:. Go Lakers!
