My research interests are deeply rooted in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and deep learning, with a strong emphasis on the mathematical underpinnings of these technologies. I am particularly fascinated by the potential applications of these mathematical principles in scientific domains, such as mathematics, astrophysics, etc., where they can play a pivotal role in processing and enhancing research efforts. Moreover, I'm passionate about leveraging deep learning to tackle complex mathematical challenges across different scientific disciplines, including computational physics, simulations, theorem proving, etc. These interests drive my curiosity at the intersection of artificial intelligence, mathematics, and scientific exploration. My ultimate goal is to build intelligent systems which can tackle significant challenges within the field of AI for Science.

I graduated with a _Bachelor's in Computer Engineering_ and briefly worked as an
ML researcher at [Relfor Labs](https://www.relfor.com/), where I specialized in developing deep neural networks for audio
data classification. Presently, I work as a software developer at [Dalton
Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages, staying informed about
technological advancements in computer science, physics, and
mathematics, while also indulging in the study of history and linguistic
anthropology. I also enjoy typography and sketching. I play basketball:basketball:. Go Lakers!
