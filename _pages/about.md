My research interests are deeply rooted in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and deep learning, with a strong emphasis on the mathematical underpinnings of these technologies. I am particularly fascinated by the potential applications of these mathematical principles in scientific domains, such as astrophysics, where they can play a pivotal role in processing and enhancing research efforts. Moreover, I'm passionate about exploring how deep learning can be leveraged to tackle complex mathematical challenges across different scientific disciplines, including computational physics and simulations. These interests drive my curiosity at the intersection of artificial intelligence, mathematics, and scientific exploration.

In addition to my mathematical pursuits, I have a keen interest in the analysis of film and literature, which I view as a complementary means of delving into human expression and cultural dynamics. I aim to bridge the gap between these diverse interests by utilizing Natural Language Processing and computer vision techniques to uncover the intricate connections between narratives, human expression, and cultural dynamics. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to extend the principles of mathematics and artificial intelligence to the realm of human creativity and cultural exploration.

I graduated with a _Bachelor's in Computer Engineering_ and briefly worked as an
ML researcher at [Relfor Labs](https://www.relfor.com/), where I specialized in developing deep neural networks for audio
data classification. Presently, I work as a software developer at [Dalton
Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages, staying informed about
technological advancements in computer science, physics, and
mathematics, while also indulging in the study of history and linguistic
anthropology. I also enjoy typography and sketching. I play basketball:basketball:. Go Lakers!
