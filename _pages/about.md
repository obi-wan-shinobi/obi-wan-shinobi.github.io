My research interests are rooted in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and deep learning. I am particularly fascinated by the mathematical underpinnings of these technologies. I'm dedicated to applying modern deep learning algorithms to astrophysics, where they can facilitate the processing of data and enhance research efforts. Additionally, I explore their application in solving various mathematical challenges. These interests drive my curiosity at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific disciplines.
